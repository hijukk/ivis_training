## Assignment for practice
Implement double linked list with the following operations:
* push item to the back of the list
* push item to the front of the list
* pop item from the back of the list
* pop item from the front of the list
* insert item at specific position
* delete item
* find item by value
* clear list

Non functional requirements:
* list should be implemented as a template class;
* copying existing implementations from Internet is strongly discouraged, but you can check frameworks or other implementations if you need ideas on how do design your class API (for example std::list);
* usage of dynamic memory is allowed;
* provide console application which contains unit tests for the list class.

Results should be submitted to git repository and contains:
* source code;
* CMake based build configuration files.
