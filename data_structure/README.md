## Assignment for practice
Implement string class. It should be possible to use this class in the same way as std::string. Class should provide (but is not limited to) following functionality:
* work with ASCII (Unicode support is not needed);
* get value length;
* get/set value;
* insert new value at specified position;
* clear string;
* get individual character;
* display value on the screen;
* print value using std::cout;
* reverse string;
* append string (using function and using + operator)
* replace sub-string with another value;
* get sub-string at specified position.
* assign, copy, move, compare operations must be supported;

Implementation requirements:
1. You can use std::string API as a reference (but feel free to design your own);
2. need to submit 2 versions:
   1. using regular pointers;
   2. using smart pointers.
3. main.cpp should contain simple unit tests for all functionality.
